        and hasn't looked back since. She enjoys the outdoors,camping, kayaking, amusement parks, roller blading and

      <h3> Meet Hannah Imeli </h3>
      <p>
        Hannah started attending Transit in 2012 when her sister Megan invited her. She has met many of her friends from
        Transit and the infamous parking lot hangouts afterwards. When she isn't working at Heinen's she enjoys reading,
        writing, spending time with family and her new niece,

      <h3>Meet Hayley Pausch</h3>
      <p>
        Hayley started attending Parkside in February of 2021, she very quickly fell in love with the solid preaching
        and made her way to Transit a few weeks later where she has planted her roots and hasn't missed a week. She
        would love to welcome you in to Transit regardless of where you stand when it comes to faith. She is often found
        rocking the color pink, a Comfy, listening to country music and typing up some code on her computer(the kind
        that helped bring you this website). She loves going on walks when it's nice out, spending quality time with
        friends and her two adorable Australian Shepherds Finley & Gracie.

        <h3> Meet William DeFord </h3>
        <p>
          William began his Transit career at the end of 2022 and was promptly greeted by Tim and Peter who made his
          transition into transit as smooth as can be. He has transformed significantly since then in his growth in
          Christ as well as his ability to relate and converse with others. He has since transitioned to serving
          alongside the music team as being part of the AV crew and he looks forward to meeting you!

          <h3> Meet Zeke Callaghan</h3>
          <p>Zeke is a 22 year old who resides in Broadview Heights. Jesus led him to Transit in June of 2023 where he
            was eager to grow in faith after a season of bewilderment. He encourages Christians to be surrounded by the
            truth of God's word and to have fellowship with other believers. He is grateful for Transit and everyone who
            has welcomed him in and encourages all to be a part of it whether starting out your faith journey, if you
            have been walking with the Lord for years or if you're unsure of what to believe about this world. Traveling
            is one of his big passions and he hopes to visit every continent in his lifetime. He loves working with
            computers, playing tennis and hanging out with his big poodle who is well behaved... sometimes.

              <h3> Meet Hannah Lerner</h3>
              <p> Hannah is a 27 year old who grew up in Brazil as her parents were missionaries, she speaks Portugese
                and Spanish. Her favorite treat is cake and her and her husband Dane are huge Cavalier fans. Her first
                time at Transit was an overwhelming one showing up late and being intimidated by the amount of people
                there. After saying to her husband that they should just leave with the intention to slip out and never
                come back they were relieved to be greeted by Cameron Cronk who kindly greeted them and made them feel
                welcomed enough to continue showing up. They are both thankful they pushed past their nerves to continue
                coming, making tons of friends and getting an extra dose of the word from Matt Ross each week which
                would have been missed out on had she turned around on the first day.

                  <p>
                    Logan is a 26 year old who started attending Transit in 2023. He'd recommend Transit to anyone.

                      <h3> Meet Mackenzie Ellman</h3>
                      <p>
                        Mackenzie came to the Parkside Green branch a few times in her undergraduate years. Upon
                        graduating she desired to be involved in an evening group and figured she could find one at the
                        main campus. She first attended Transit in the summer of 2021 but felt too young compared to
                        others and picked up new work in the meantime. Two years later she eased herself back into
                        Transit and became a regular attendee. She enjoys hanging out with friends and through that has
                        found a love for board and card games, mini golf and hiking. She also enjoys biking around her
                        neighborhood, kayaking, cleaning and learning how to cook and bake new recipes.

                      <h3>Meet Dane Lerner</h3>
                      <p>Dane is Cleveland born and raised. He loves anything that has peanut butter in it. He enjoys
                        cooking and eating together with others. After decades of prayer for his wife the two crossed
                        paths a few years ago and are now (as of 5 months) happily married! A cool testimony from him is
                        that when he was 12 years old he went to the Loft when it was still called “the warehouse” held
                        for the middle schoolers. He constantly prayed for all the people that would be attending that
                        building. The same blessed building that today Transit is now held. Where he continues to pray
                        for it.

                    <h3> Meet Jemima Ukwela</h3>
                      <p> Jemima has been involved in Transit since around 2020, after Standpoint (the college age ministry) became a part of Transit. In being a part of Transit these couple of years, it has been and continues to be a special space for her in her young adults years — through connecting with others weekly who desire to live for Christ and share Him with others, praying and encouraging one another as we face similar life circumstances, and enjoying community in fun happenings (i.e., game nights, volleyball, grabbing Mitchell's ice cream). If one is looking for a place to build meaningful connections in this way, she hopes you find the same experience of Transit as a place you feel invited to join and welcomed in!</p>
